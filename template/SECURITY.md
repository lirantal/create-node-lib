# Security Policy

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues**.

## Responsible disclosure security policy

A responsible disclosure policy helps protect users of the project from public disclosure of security vulnerabilities without a fix available. We achieve that by following the process where vulnerabilities are first triaged in a private manner, and are only publicly disclosed after a reasonable time period of the patch being available for users.

We kindly ask you to refrain from malicious acts that put our users, the project, or any of the projectâ€™s team members at risk.

## Reporting a security issue

We consider the security of the project a top priority.

If you discover a security vulnerability, please use one of the following means of communications to report it to us:

- Report the security issue to the [Snyk Security Team](https://snyk.io/vulnerability-disclosure). They will help triage the security issue and work with all involved parties to remediate and release a fix.

We sincerely appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings with us.
